# TwitSplit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.

The product Tweeter allows users to post short messages limited to 50 characters each. 
 
Sometimes, users get excited and write messages longer than 50 characters. 
 
Instead of rejecting these messages, we would like to add a new feature that will split the message into parts and send multiple messages on the user's behalf, all of them meeting the 50 character requirement.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
